    <h2 id="t2">About me</h2>
    <p width="50%"><em>I am an eternal learner. Being a highly motivated and sociable team player, I reckon that 
        it is vital to have a big picture in mind and only then look at the details. This mindset 
        helps me to come up with the most rational and effective solution to almost any problem that 
        comes up. I am also passionate to learn new things and gain experience in fields other than 
        my major.
        I was genuinely interested in programming since middle school, when we were first introduced to 
        IT subject at school. However, I did not pursue my passion in learning programming because of 
        my fear and stigma that girls are not good at IT. But here I am now, finally dedicating time to 
        learn what I am passionate about. I hope that this course in web development from decode.kz will 
        help me to headstart in the IT industry.</em></p><hr>
